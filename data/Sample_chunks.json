    "text": "Velvet bean–Mucuna pruriens var. utilis, also known as mucuna—is a twining annual leguminous vine common to most parts of the tropics. Its growth is restricted to the wet-season as it dies at the onset of the cold season. It has large trifoliate leaves (i.e. has three leaflets) and very long vigorous twining stems that can extend over two–three metres depending on growth conditions. When planted at the beginning of the growing season, flowers normally form at the end of March/early April. These flowers are deep purple and appear underneath the foliage. Seeds are large, ovoid shaped (±10 mm long) and of different colours, ranging from white, grey, brown to black and mottled."

    "text": "The velvet bean can be grown for soil fertility, green manure and as a cover crop in conservation agriculture (CA). The velvet bean is a high yielding leguminous forage crop—high in nitrogen (N)/crude protein content. It is usually sown as an N-fixing ley crop or as a green manure crop to improve soil fertility. In the sub-humid regions it can be intercropped with maize to improve soil fertility, maximize grain/herbage yields per unit area and provide mixed crop for hay/silage making. Whether it is grown as a single or mixed crop, the velvet bean provides early dry season grazing or fodder for hay or mixed-crop silage, improving the N content of cereal or grass silage."

Mucuna is a prolific seeder and its seed (26 % crude protein) can be used in home-mixed rations to replace commercial supplements. However, its grain is not so useful to non-ruminant livestock. It can only be used for human consumption after reducing its toxicity by boiling and discarding the water several times."

    "text": "Velvet bean performs best in regions with long growing seasons and prefers hot moist areas that receive 650–2500 mm of rainfall per annum. It can withstand long dry spells, especially when established early in the growing season. Consequently, velvet bean farming is increasingly being adopted in semi-arid regions (e.g. natural regions IV and V of Zimbabwe). It will grow well into the dry season until frosted or deep soil moisture runs out. Its seeds mature around May and June. Velvet bean grows well in a wide range of soils, including relatively infertile sandy soils."

Application of 500–700 kg/ha lime (preferably dolomitic lime on sandy soils) is recommended to encourage nodulation and efficient use of fertilizers. Mucuna will thrive on soils where available soil phosphorus (P) is low. Application of 200–250 kg/ha single superphosphate (18.5 % P2O5) is sufficient for optimum herbage and seed production. Alternatively, one can apply 250–300 kg of compound fertilizer (preferably 7 N : 14 P : 7 K)."

    "text": "The velvet bean is a very vigorous climber; therefore it should be planted in-between cereals 3–4 weeks after they emerge (depending on predicted annual rainfall), ideally after the first hand weeding if farmers are not using herbicides. If planted too early and densely, it can choke the cereal, thereby reducing cereal yield. Planting the velvet bean within the same row as maize and in-between the maize plants facilitates weeding and spraying. However, delaying the planting of legume for more than four weeks after sowing cereals may result in shading by the cereal crop and severe reduction in legume yield. It is advisable to sow one pip per station, at a spacing of 50 cm within a row."

Flowering occurs in early March and is triggered by the shorter days and cooler night temperatures (21 °C). Due to its profuse seeding ability and the high feeding value of its grain, farmers prefer to harvest it when the pods are mature and dry; then they can harvest the foliage residue together with the pods. Mucuna has achieved average herbage yields of 7–11 t dry matter/ha in natural region II and 4–6 t dry matter/ha in regions IV and V of Zimbabwe, when harvested at booting stage."

Intercropped forage is best conserved as silage; no sugar additives are required if the mixed crop is harvested when the cereal component is at milk-dough stage. Pods can be hand-harvested and spread under shade to dry before shelling by pounding with long sticks; clean seed is obtained by winnowing. Mucuna can yield up to 2 t of clean seed per hectare, and the shell-to-grain ratio is normally 1:1."

    "text": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."

    "text": "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains."

In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs."

In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2."
